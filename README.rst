.. Give notice about early stages

**Note:** This project is in very early development and is not thoroughly
tested.

.. Description

Initially created to help those looking to escape the tedious workings
involved in testing and writing `duckyscripts
<https://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript>`_ for hak5's
`Rubber Ducky <https://hakshop.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe>`_, duckpy
is capable of executing duckyscript right on a target machine by translating
given commands into executable Python functions. It's essentially **an open
source duckyscript interpreter written in Python.**
