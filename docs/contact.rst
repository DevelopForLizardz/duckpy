=======

Please report any issues and (submit any pull requests) directly on the
`github page <https://github.com/developforlizardz/duckpy>`_. There is no
standard contribution format (yet?) so no need to worry about that, however
clarity and detail is always appreciated.

Any other questions, comments, concerns, requests, etc. can be send to the
developer directly (Ryan Drew) at ``developforlizardz@gmail.com``. Thanks!
